## How to use

### Requirements

Make sure [Meteor is installed and up to date](https://www.meteor.com/install) or run:

```
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

### Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:amazingBastard/mtr-portfolio.git

meteor
```

### Deployments

It is highly recommended to use [Meteor Up](https://github.com/arunoda/meteor-up) for easy deployments.
Have a look at the repository for more information.

There are other ways to deploy to your server besides Meteor Up. Here is a [step by step guide from Digital Ocean](http://devo.ps/blog/deploy-your-meteor-apps-on-digital-ocean-in-5-minutes/).
